## Why use Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language that provides developers building many kinds of applications and has a growing community that helps improving it's ecosystem. In addition, it's easy to build and run.

## Usage

`$ python main.py -v`

This will run all test cases inside `tests/` folder.

## Notes

You can check the algorithm solution inside `sample/helltriangle.py`. It's uses recursion and avoids repeated calculations when the sum path can merge.
